# SOC Automation

## Objective

The SOC Automation Lab project aims to create a controlled environment for detecting and responding to both real and simulated cyber attacks. This project focuses on ingesting and analyzing logs within a SIEM system ([Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)) to use a SOAR platform ([Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/)) for establishing custom workflows that create automatic responses to specific security events. Additionally, a case manager ([TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/)) is utilized to generate and manage alerts corresponding to those produced by the SIEM system.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Creation of automatic responses to security events using a SOAR platform.
- Alert creation and management using a case manager.
- Integration of complex security tools to create a cohesive and automated security operations workflow.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh as SIEM system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Shuffle as SOAR platform for creation of automatic responses.
- TheHive as case manager to create formal alerts of security events
